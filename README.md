# what is this?

The sundowner-fc code base was developed as part of the preparation for the Sundowner Flight Club as well as extracted from a solution developed for the Richmond Pilots Corporation, a flight club originally based at Miller Field in Staten Island but later moved to KLDJ when Miller Field was closed.

It leverages the Django Framework to provide mostly the day to day operations of a flight club or school. Specifically, it provides member management, scheduling and management of aircraft as well as invoicing, etc.

# what is it not?

It is not a traditional 'website' to post information about your club or pictures of your last gathering. That said there is a basic information page that is customizable to some extend and we suggest that you want something more social that you use a facebook page, etc, tools that are developed specifically for socializing. You can link to those pages (facebook, instagram, twitter, slack, etc) from this default information page.

# lineage
The founder of this project (and the Sundowners Flight Club) was a member of the US naval squadron VF-111 (1956-95), as serves as the direct lineage of the Sundowner legacy.
